A Python library to help make your Machine Learning easier

We were inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qRgWubbPxQ) friendly Beluga whale to help others in their Machine Learning projects.

Following this [guide](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-python-library-7d5aea80cc3f)

## Running Code
Run the code from the home direcotry for any development as follows:
```
python -m beluga.metrics
```
python -m beluga.metrics
## Tests
Run the tests from the library home directory with the following:
```
python -m setup pytest
```
Check the coverage of these tests using:
